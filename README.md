# SequenceOfNumbers
A program that asks the user for an integer N (limit) and calculates its sum
fractions ∑x = 1
Ν
(1 / x), ie 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 +… + 1 / N (pay attention to formula conversions, the sum is
float type). Assume that the user always enters an integer greater than or equal to 1 (not required
control). Display the result to the nearest 2 decimal places.
